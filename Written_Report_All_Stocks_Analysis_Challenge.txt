# All Stocks Analysis Refactored Code

## Overview of Project
# Having helped Steve to iterate and determine performance year over year for his parents stock. 
# He is concerned about the time it takes to complete the iterations and results. 
# The refactored code is rearranged for efficiency and timing that will show him 
# he can deplore this towards a much more larger dataset.

## Results
# The runtime on the refactored code for both years were better.
# For 2017, 1.164 seconds was improved to 1.125 seconds
# For 2018, 1.156 seconds was improved to 1.085 seconds
# ENPH performed very well in both years whilst others were 
# below previous year performance
# Except RUN that made a great jump in 2018

### Summary
# Refactoring the code improves performance generally whilst also 
# improving the understanding of the developer. 
# Advantage of refactoring the code is to improve runtime and also 
# understanding in general about being a developer and also team member
